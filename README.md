# Employee Management System (EMS)

A full-stack employee management system with role-based access control (RBAC), organizational hierarchy management, and secure authentication — built with Next.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, fully containerized with Docker.

## Features

- **JWT-based authentication** with bcrypt password hashing
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** — field-level enforcement, not just route-level (e.g. sensitive fields like salary are protected at the model layer)
- **Self-referencing organizational hierarchy** with cycle detection (prevents invalid reporting structures)
- **Employee management** — full CRUD with search, filter, sort, and pagination handled server-side
- **CSV bulk import** with per-row error handling
- **Dashboard** with live aggregated stats
- **Dark mode** (class-based theming)
- **Automated tests** covering auth, RBAC edge cases, and organizational hierarchy logic

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (includes Docker Compose)
- Git

No local installation of Node.js, npm, or PostgreSQL is required — everything runs inside containers.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yashhh0602/Employee-Management-System.git
cd Employee-Management-System
```

### 2. Environment variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend/` folder (this is gitignored and not included in the repo for security):

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=postgres
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=ems_db
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
JWT_SECRET=replace_this_with_a_long_random_string
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1h
```

> **Note:** `DB_HOST` must be `postgres` (the Docker service name), not `localhost`, since the backend connects to the database over the internal Docker network.

### 3. Build and start all services

From the project root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts three containers:
- `postgres` — PostgreSQL database (port `5432`)
- `backend` — Express API server (port `5000`)
- `frontend` — Next.js app (port `3000`)

Wait for the logs to show the backend connected to the database and the frontend ready. First build may take a few minutes.

### 4. Seed the database (first run only)

In a new terminal, run the seed script inside the backend container to create initial users and sample data:

```bash
docker exec -it ems-backend-1 npm run seed
```

> **Warning:** this drops and recreates all tables (`sequelize.sync({ force: true })`) — only run this on a fresh database. Running it again later will wipe any existing data.

This creates three accounts, one for each role, useful for testing RBAC:

| Role         | Email              | Password    |
|--------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Super Admin  | `admin@ems.com`    | `Admin@123` |
| HR Manager   | `hr@ems.com`       | `Hr@12345`  |
| Employee     | `employee@ems.com` | `Emp@12345` |

> These are default seed credentials for local/dev use only. Change them (or seed different data) before any real/production use.

### 5. Access the app

- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login)
- Backend API: [http://localhost:5000/api](http://localhost:5000/api)

Log in with any of the accounts above.

## Running in the Background

To run the app without keeping the terminal open:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To stop everything:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To view logs while running detached:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

## Running Tests

Backend tests (auth, RBAC, organizational hierarchy) run inside the backend container:

```bash
docker exec -it ems-backend-1 npm test
```

## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use (3000, 5000, or 5432):**
Something else on your machine is using that port. Find and stop it:

```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# macOS/Linux
lsof -i :5000
kill -9 <PID>
```

**Backend can't connect to the database:**
Ensure `DB_HOST=postgres` in `backend/.env` (not `localhost`) — the backend needs the Docker service name to resolve the database over the internal network.

**Changes to code not reflecting:**
Rebuild the affected container:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

**Full reset (clears all data):**

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build
```

The `-v` flag also removes the database volume, giving you a completely fresh start.

## API Documentation

## Deployment

- **Frontend:** [https://employee-management-system-silk-omega.vercel.app/login](https://employee-management-system-silk-omega.vercel.app/login)
- **Backend API:** [https://employee-management-system-w2cm.onrender.com/api](https://employee-management-system-w2cm.onrender.com/api)

> Hosted on Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend + PostgreSQL). Note: the free Render tier spins down after inactivity, so the first request after idle time may take 30–60 seconds to respond while it wakes up.
